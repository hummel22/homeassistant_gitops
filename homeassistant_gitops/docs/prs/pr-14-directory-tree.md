On the git tabs page to the left of the the Working tree diff card we want to add a directory tree. It should have the standard directory tree options for browsing git files, (compare with examples of other frameworks)
 - we want a tree of files that have changed, staged and unstaged
 - maybe slight color coded based on state (stage/unstages/unchagned, ignored, etc)
 - clicking on a file auto scrolls to that diff
 - can shift/cmd click to highlight multple options and apply stage or unstage to all selected
 - maybe in the top of the directory tree add the ability to swtich between viewing all files, vs just those that have a diff (staged & unstages)
  - clicking on a unchanged file shows the whole file contents, if is binary dont show, just say is binary
  - on diff cards, add the ability to see the whole file, , still show the diff view, but the whole file side by side, highlight the diff spots
